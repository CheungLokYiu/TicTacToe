# TicTacToe
Tic-tac-toe using Java.
This is a board game starting with an empty board of size 3x3 = 9 slots for two players ‘X’ and ‘O’ who take turn to make a move in at most 9 rounds, with player ‘X’ first. In each move, a new piece of the player is marked in an empty slot on the board. Whoever can get 3 straightly-connected sameside pieces first wins the game; or it is a Draw Game if all slots are occupied (round 9) but without winner.
One more class TicTacToeWithSaveGame that is a subclass of TicTacToe. It adds a feature of saving the game history to a file named "ttt.txt" in current working folder.
